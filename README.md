# Project for mobile development course

## Overview 
This application allows users find books, read descriptions of books, add to favorites, add to the shoppingcart and listen to fragments of audiobooks.
Throughout this project, I learned the basics of mobile development, got familiar with the React Native framework, learned the basics of memory management with Redux.

## Tech stack
*React Native: A popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
*Firebase: A cloud-based database system for real-time data storage and retrieval.
*Redux: A predictable state management library for managing application state efficiently.
